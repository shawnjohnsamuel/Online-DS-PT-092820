    "In this lesson, you reviewed 3 major foundational concepts for probability: permutations, combinations, and conditional probability. Remember that your standard padlock should be more accurately called a permutation lock! Order matters for permutations, whereas only the members of the set are important for combinations. Conditional probability investigates the odds of an event occurring given other information. In these instances, the universal set of possibilities reflects the given information. In the mushroom example, the probability of a mushroom being edible given that it is bruised can be computed by dividing the probability that it a mushroom is both edible AND bruised, by the probability that it is bruised. \n",
