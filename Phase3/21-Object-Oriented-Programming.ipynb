    "# Intro to Object Oriented Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course we've learned how to create objects from the built-in classes that are provided by python. This includes `int`s, `str`s and `list`s. In addition, you have learned how to organize your programs into a series of functions that process/manipulate your data. This is known as procedural programming. Now, we'll learn a bit about object oriented programming, that allows you to create your own objects and procedures from classes you design. OOP is useful because it speeds up development and makes your code more reusable.\n",
